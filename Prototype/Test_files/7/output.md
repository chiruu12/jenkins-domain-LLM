### Root Cause
The failure appears to be caused by a Jenkins agent being offline, as indicated in the logs. This can lead to subsequent tasks failing due to the inability to execute builds on that agent.

### Evidence
*   **Agent Offline Evidence:** Logs indicate the agent is not available to execute builds.

    ```
*   **Jenkins Instance Missing Evidence:** Absence of a valid Jenkins instance is indicated in the following error log snippet.
    ```
    FATAL: Jenkins.instance is missing. Read the documentation of Jenkins.getInstanceOrNull to see what you are doing wrong.

    ```

### Suggested Fix
1. Check the status of the Jenkins agent `gcp-freebsd-13-1-a` and ensure it is online and properly configured.
2. If the agent is offline, investigate the reason (e.g., network issues, unauthorized access) and bring it back online.
3. Restart the Jenkins server if 'Jenkins.instance' continues to produce errors after addressing the agent.
4. Ensure that there are no configuration issues within Jenkins that might lead to this non-responsive state.
