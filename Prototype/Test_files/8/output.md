### Root Cause
The build failed primarily due to permission issues on the Jenkins agent, preventing access to certain files, and the workspace not being recognized as a valid Git repository.     

### Evidence
*   **Workspace and Git Errors:** The logs indicate issues with Git repository recognition and file permissions.

    ```
    fatal: not a git repository (or any parent up to mount point /var)
    Stopping at filesystem boundary (GIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM not set).
    /tmp/jenkins18431518907590721830.sh: line 10: datefile: Permission denied
    ```
*   **Persistent Permission Denial:** The repeated permission denied errors suggest a persistent issue with file access rights during the shell script execution.

    ```
    /tmp/jenkins18431518907590721830.sh: line 14: datefile: Permission denied
    ```

### Suggested Fix
1.  Check the permission settings on the Jenkins agent where the build is running. Ensure that the Jenkins user has appropriate read and write permissions for the workspace and temporary directories.
2.  Verify that the workspace at `/var/jenkins_home/workspace/Bugs-Individual/Bugs-10-000-to-19-999/JENKINS-14917-create-tag-and-poll-scm` is a valid Git repository. If it's not, reseed the repository or configure the correct SCM settings in the Jenkins job.
