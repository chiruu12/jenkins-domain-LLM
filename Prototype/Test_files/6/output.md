### Root Cause
The failure occurred due to a critical error indicating that `Jenkins.instance is missing`, which suggests that the Jenkins server encountered a fundamental issue when attempting to run the build process.

### Evidence
*   **[Critical Error in Logs]:** The presence of a critical error in the logs indicates failure in Jenkins operation.
    ```
    FATAL: Jenkins.instance is missing. Read the documentation of Jenkins.getInstanceOrNull to see what you are doing wrong.
    java.lang.IllegalStateException: Jenkins.instance is missing. Read the documentation of Jenkins.getInstanceOrNull to see what you are doing wrong.
    ```
*   **[Scope of Impact]:** This issue affected the ability to trigger builds or use existing resources. It surfaced multiple times throughout the log output and halted various operations.

### Suggested Fix
1. Verify the Jenkins server's health and ensure that it is up and running properly without any misconfigurations.
2. Restart the Jenkins instance if feasible, as this might rectify transient issues affecting its internal state.
3. Check the Jenkins logs for any preceding errors or issues that might provide additional context regarding the `Jenkins.instance is missing` error.
4. Ensure all required plugins are updated and compatible with your version of Jenkins, as a plugin malfunction could lead to this issue.
