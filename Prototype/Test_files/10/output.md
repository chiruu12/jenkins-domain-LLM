### Root Cause
The build failed due to Git LFS (Large File Storage) objects not being found on the server, resulting in a 404 error during the `lfs pull` operation.

### Evidence
*   **Git LFS Pull Error:** The specific Git command that triggered the failure.

    ```
    Command "/usr/bin/git lfs pull private" returned status code 2:
    stdout:
    stderr: [5ab5fbefb7a6234905e1b79f95d70e2969c049d07d5140ee2dfc80f8dd3a0110] Object does not exist on the server: [404] Object does not exist on the server
    ```

*   **Additional Context:** The log shows multiple instances of LFS objects returning 404 errors, indicating they cannot be retrieved from the server.

    ```
    [1639b22999dcffae1c64a2c1e91f3de6c687e4f0444aab860eb26fbd07f2ffd6] Object does not exist on the server: [404] Object does not exist on the server
    [ce0a4e06a8773c52004d065c638a8e867f02f4ce4d5c41579aea397fd2288497] Object does not exist on the server: [404] Object does not exist on the server
    ```

### Suggested Fix
1.  Verify that the LFS objects that are supposed to be available in the repository are indeed present. Check the repository settings and confirm the objects' storage.
2.  Ensure that the LFS files were properly pushed to the GitHub repository. If not, they need to be uploaded to the remote repository again.
3.  If the objects were deleted from the repository, consider restoring them from backups if available or adjust references to eliminate the need for those files.

#### Example Fix (Optional)
If you find that you need to push the missing LFS objects again, you can use the following command in your local LFS repository:
```bash
git lfs push --all origin master
```
