### Root Cause
The primary reason for the failure is that the Jenkins instance is not in a ready state, leading to multiple attempts to access `Jenkins.instance` being unsuccessful, which causes the build to fail.

### Evidence
*   **Jenkins Instance Error:** Failure due to missing Jenkins instance.
    ```
    FATAL: Jenkins.instance is missing. Read the documentation of Jenkins.getInstanceOrNull to see what you are doing wrong.
    java.lang.IllegalStateException: Jenkins.instance is missing. Read the documentation of Jenkins.getInstanceOrNull to see what you are doing wrong.
    ```
*   **Queue Issue:** Indication that build configurations cannot be interrupted.

    ```

### Suggested Fix
1. Check if the Jenkins master is running and responsive. You can do this by going to the main Jenkins dashboard in your web browser.
2. Restart the Jenkins service to resolve any transient issues that may be causing the `Jenkins.instance` to be unavailable. This can usually be done via command line with `sudo service jenkins restart` or through the Jenkins management interface, depending on your setup.
3. Investigate any plugin or configuration changes that were made recently, as these may impact the state of the Jenkins instance. Revert any changes if necessary or ensure they are compatible with your current Jenkins version.
4. Monitor the Jenkins logs (`jenkins.log` or equivalent) for any additional errors during the startup that may give more context to the issue.
