### Root Cause
The build failed due to a script returning exit code 1, indicating that a command in the script encountered an error, specifically the command attempting to list a non-existent directory 'target'.

### Evidence
*   **[Directory Not Found]:** The specific error message indicating the cause of the failure.
    ```
    + ls -d target
    ls: target: No such file or directory
    ```
*   **[Script Exit Code]:** The exit code from the pipeline indicating failure.
    ```
    ERROR: script returned exit code 1
    ```

### Suggested Fix
1. Ensure that the `target` directory is created and populated with the appropriate files before attempting to list it with the `ls` command.
2. Check the preceding build steps to confirm that the Maven build process or its equivalent is executed correctly and completes successfully, creating the `target` directory in the process.
