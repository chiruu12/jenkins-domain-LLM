### Root Cause
The failure is primarily due to the Jenkins server being unable to fetch changes from the remote Git repository, likely because it cannot find a valid revision to build.

### Evidence
*   **[Checkout Error]:** Issue found during Git fetching.
    ```
    ERROR: Couldn't find any revision to build. Verify the repository and branch configuration for this job.
    ERROR: Maximum checkout retry attempts reached, aborting
    ```
*   **[Git Tool Warning]:** Missing git tool configuration.
    ```
    The recommended git tool is: NONE
    No credentials specified
    ```

### Suggested Fix
1.  Verify the Git repository URL and branch configuration in the Jenkins job settings to ensure they are correct.
2.  Check if the Jenkins Git plugin is properly configured and that the Jenkins user has the required credentials to access the Git repository.
