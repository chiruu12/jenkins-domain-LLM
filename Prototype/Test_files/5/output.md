### Root Cause
The failure seems to have been caused by a partial success in building on some agent nodes while the build failed on the `jdk21,mark-pc6-ssh` node, but the logs do not provide specific infrastructure errors directly related to this node.

### Evidence
*   **[Git Connection Failure]:** Incomplete Git operation at the beginning of the build process.
    ```
    > /usr/bin/git fetch --no-tags --force --progress -- https://github.com/MarkEWaite/jenkins-demo +refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master # timeout=3
    [GITEA] do not publish assets due to build being non-Successfully
    ```
*   **[Build Failure on Specific Agent]:** Final build status indicating a problem with a specific Jenkins agent node.
    ```
    Tools » ant-auto-install-check » jdk21,mark-pc6-ssh completed with result FAILURE
    ```

### Suggested Fix
1. Check the status of the `mark-pc6-ssh` agent for connectivity issues or other errors such as being offline or overloaded.
2. Investigate the Jenkins logs for any errors related to the state of the `mark-pc6-ssh` agent or resource availability, such as CPU or memory overload.
